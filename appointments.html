<div class="page-header"><h1>Home Visits</h1></div>

<p>Our doctors typically see three patients in the practice in the time it takes to do a single home visit.</p>
<p>For this reason, we ask our patients to come to the practice if at all possible.</p>
<p>However, we can visit you at home if your circumstances prevent you from attending our practices. Please 
ring before 10am to arrange a visit and let us know if your condition is urgent.</p>
