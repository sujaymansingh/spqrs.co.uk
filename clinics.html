<div class="page-header"><h1>Clinics</h1></div>

<p>We run a range of clinics. For an appointment or further details, please call the Surgery.</p>


<h2>Antenatal</h2>

<p>This clinic is run by the midwives. If you become pregnant, you will be given a 'booking appointment' in which the midwife will ask you a few questions and carry out some general health checks.</p>

<p>You will be seen regularly throughout your pregnancy either at the practice and/or at the local hospital.</p>

<p>The Doctors at this practice do not provide the 24 hour baby check. We believe that this service is best provided by the Hospital Doctors.</p>


<h2>Child health and immunisation</h2>

<p>Provided by a Health Visitor.</p>

<p>All new babies are invited for regular check-ups from when they are eight weeks old.</p>


<h2>Diabetes, Asthma &amp; Hypertension</h2>

<p>Led by our nursing team, these clinics offer advice and general health check-ups to patients diagnosed with the medical problems mentioned above.</p>


<h2>Travel Vaccinations</h2>

<p>For an appointment with the Practice nurse please phone main reception.</p>


<h2>Specialist and hospital care</h2>

<p>If a GP or another member of our health care team believes you need hospital treatment or specialist care elsewhere, they will ask you where you would like to go. They can then refer you to that Hospital.</p>

<p>However certain specialities are not available at all the three major Leicester hospitals.</p>
